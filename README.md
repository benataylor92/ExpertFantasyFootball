# Expert Fantasy Football

This repository provides a brief introduction to fantasy football, a popular game where participants assemble virtual teams of real-life professional athletes. The performance of these athletes in actual games determines the success of each fantasy team.

## What Is Fantasy Football?

Fantasy football is a competition in which players draft, manage, and compete with teams of NFL athletes. Each participant selects players at various positions (such as quarterback, running back, and wide receiver) with the goal of scoring more points than their opponents throughout the football season. Points are earned based on the real-world statistics those players accumulate in NFL games, such as yards gained or touchdowns scored.

Fantasy football often involves a league of friends or coworkers who schedule a draft before the season starts. Once the season is underway, team owners set lineups each week, manage their rosters through trades or free agency, and track scores in hopes of reaching the playoffs and winning their league's championship.

## Getting Started
